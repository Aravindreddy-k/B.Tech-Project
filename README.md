"Finite element analysis of cold deep drawing process for Conical cups 0f AA-1100"

• Deep drawing is one of the most widely used processes in sheet metal forming.
• The study was conducted by using DEFORM-3D. DEFORM-3D supports user routines and user defined variables.
• The purpose of present work is to analyze the deep drawing process of thin-walled AA 1100, conical cup shape by means of a finite element simulation.
• In the present study, simulation of the deep drawing process for determining distribution patterns of process parameters were punch velocity, thickness of the blank and coefficient of friction have been found influencing the quality of the cup.
• It is evident from the results that considered parameters can alter the physical characteristics of the cup obtained at the end of the drawing operation.
